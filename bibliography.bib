abstract = {The dramatic increase of attacks and malicious activities has made security a major concern in the development of interconnected cyber-physical systems and raised the need to address this concern also in testing. The goal of security testing is to discover vulnerabilities in the system under test so that they can be fixed before an attacker finds and abuses them. However, testing for security issues faces the challenge of systematically exploring a potentially non-tractable number of interaction scenarios that have to include also invalid inputs and possible harmful interaction attempts. In this paper, we describe an approach for automated generation of test cases for security testing, which are based on attack patterns. These patterns are blueprints that can be used for exploiting common vulnerabilities. The approach combines random test case generation with attack patterns implemented for the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. We have applied the proposed testing approach to five popular and widely available MQTT brokers, generating 1,804 interaction sequences in form of executable test cases which resulted in numerous test failures, unhandled exceptions and crashes. A detailed manual analysis of these cases have revealed 28 security-relevant issues and critical shortcomings in the tested MQTT broker implementations.},

abstract = {The increasing vulnerabilities found in Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the need for a solid mechanism of securing the firmware update of these connected objects, since firmware updates are one way to patch vulnerabilities and add security features. This survey analyses the types of attacks that target the firmware update operation in IoT devices and the available secure firmware update methods for IoT devices in the literature between 2004 and 2018. In addition, several popular firmware analysis and vulnerability detection tools are presented. We believe this paper will open the possibility for firmware analysis, attacks and security and therefore help researchers to develop new mechanisms to protect the embedded systems.},
